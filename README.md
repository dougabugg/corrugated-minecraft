# corrugated-minecraft
Corrugated Paper and Minecraft, what more could you want? So what actually is this project? Well, I want to run a minecraft server.
I dislike the current plugin/modding setup, with bugs, confusing documentation, outdated projects, and what not.
So I figured, why not taking a stab at making my own plugin/mods to do exactly what I want, how I want?
This repository is my "playground" as I dive into modifying minecraft (probably just the server for now).
