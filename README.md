# corrugated-minecraft
Corrugated Paper and Minecraft, what more could you want? So what actually is this project? Well, I want to run a minecraft server.
I dislike the current plugin/modding setup, with bugs, confusing documentation, outdated projects, and what not.
So I figured, why not taking a stab at making my own plugin/mods to do exactly what I want, how I want?
This repository is my "playground" as I dive into modifying minecraft (probably just the server for now).

Now, you may say, "What?! Make your own plugin/mod API? Why on EARTH would you want to do that?!" The reason is that I enjoy
tinkering with things, and breaking things, and figuring out how they work. If I have an idea for a mini-game mod, I don't
want my creativity constrained by "wow, the modding API for `X Y Z` server doesn't make it very easy to implement that".
Thus, I will take my own path through the woods, bush whacking as I go. That's just how I roll, I guess.
